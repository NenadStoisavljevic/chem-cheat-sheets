# Chemistry Cheat Sheets

The summary sheets summarize majority of the concepts covered in the SCH3U0 and SCH4U0 courses. These sheets can be useful for students studying chemistry in their senior years of high school, as many new concepts will be built on the ones that are summarized in the sheets. Each of the summary sheets are double-sided to provide all the information you need in a compressed amount of space. Since the topics are not too advanced, they are all relatively well covered, given the constraints of the layout. The main purpose of these summary sheets is for students to use them as a reference guide, when reviewing or studying for their following years of chemistry to come.

In these study sheets, various examples and diagrams were included to extend on many of the concepts. Notably, examples of how to determine the molecular formula of a hydrate, etc., can be replicated for other scenarios.

Due to time constraints, important concepts in unit 4 of the SCH3U0 course regarding acid and base theories were not included. These are important theories which should not be overlooked, as they will definitely be explored later on in more advanced chemistry classes. It is better to expose yourself early on to these theories, as it will give you a better understanding of acid-base titrations and neutralization reactions.
